Jon Deibel's React Talk Code
=====================

This is based off of [react-hot-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate) which is a minimal dev environment to enable live-editing React components.

### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Reasons for the bare-bones approach

For a simple talk I want to give an approach that gets you up and started developing using react as fast as possible.
I decided that including a bunch of production-ready webpack build code would be convoluted and generally harder to
convey what I want.
